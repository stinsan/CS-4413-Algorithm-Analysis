# Chapter 23: Minimum Spanning Trees

The **minimum spanning tree** problem: Given an undirected graph _G_ = (_V, E_), each edge (_u, v_) ∈ _E_ has a weight _w_(_u, v_) specifying the cost to connect _u_ and _v_. We then wish to find an acyclic subset _T_ ⊆ _E_ that connects all of the vertices and whose total weight is minimized.
