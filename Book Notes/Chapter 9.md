# Chapter 9: Medians and Order Statistics

The _i_ th **order statistic** of a set of _n_ elements is the _i_ th smallest element. Thus, the **minimum** of a set is the 1st order
statistic and the **maximum** of the set is the _n_ th order statistic.

The **median** of a set is the element at location _floor( (n + 1) / 2 )_.

## 9.1 | Minimum and Maximum

This is how to find the minimum value with an upper bound of _n - 1_ comparisons:
