# Algorithm Analysis

These are my notes for the Algorithm Analysis (CS 4413) course taught by Dr. Qi Cheng during the Fall 2019 semester 
at the University of Oklahoma. These notes were taken directly from selected chapters of the textbook, _Introduction to Algorithms 3rd ed._ 
by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein, and paraphrased by me. Some chapters and sections were omitted because they were not covered in 
class.
